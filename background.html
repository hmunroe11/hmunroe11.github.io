    	<p>Although I have never taken a higher level course in photography, I have taken a high school level course and was taught by a professional photographer.</p>

    	<p>I have been interested in photography since I was a child and I would always steal my mom's camera or phone and go outside to take pictures of anything I could find that looked interesting.</p>

    	<p>This has led me to where I am today, taking photographs for fun! I mainly use my phone camera but sometimes I use an older Canon make camera that my family has had for years.</p>

    	<p>One day I hope to expand my knowledge of the art of photography and continue to learn about the many aspects of taking good photos.</p>
