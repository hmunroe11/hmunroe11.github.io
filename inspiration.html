    	<h1>Inspiration</h1>

    	<p>Most of my inspiration comes from the wildnerness and experiencing the world as it is naturally. When I take pictures, I look for little things that catch my eye or large landscapes that are simply beautiful to look at.</p>

    	<p>Below are links to a few of my favorite places that I have visited and taken photos at. Enjoy!</p>
